In theÂ root of the project you run `mitosis` from, you can add a `mitosis.config.js` file that will be read by Mitosis. Checkout [the types](/packages/core/src/types/config.ts) for what settings you can provide.

Note that you can configure each target generator individually, providing plugins on a case-by-case basis.
