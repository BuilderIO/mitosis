# Mitosis Mono-repo Starter

This is a mono-repo for Mitosis libraries. It contains a few workspaces to get you started.

## Workspaces

- [library](./library/): the workspace containing your Mitosis project.
  - [packages/library/src](./packages/library/src): the source code of your Mitosis project
  - [library/packages](./library/packages/): the outputs generated by Mitosis
- [servers](./servers/): the workspace containing servers that import your Mitosis servers

## Developing

1. Run Mitosis in watch mode

```bash
cd library
npm run start
```

2. If the output has its own bundling step (like Svelte/Qwik), you will need to run that build step in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd library/qwik
npm run build:watch
```

3. Finally, run the corresponding test server of your library from the previous step to see your Mitosis project in action:

```bash
cd servers/qwik
npm run dev
```
