# Mitosis Mono-repo Starter

This is a mono-repo for Mitosis libraries. It contains a few workspaces to get you started.

## Workspaces

- [library](./library/): the workspace containing your Mitosis project.
  - [packages/library/src](./packages/library/src): the source code of your Mitosis project
  - [library/packages](./library/packages/): the outputs generated by Mitosis
- [servers](./servers/): the workspace containing servers that import your Mitosis servers

## Getting started

1. Run Mitosis in watch mode

```bash
cd library
npm run start
```

2. Run a server to see your Mitosis project in action

```bash
cd servers/react
npm run dev
```
