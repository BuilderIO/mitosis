# Quick Start

To create a new Mitosis project from scratch, run the following `create` command:

```bash
npm create @builder.io/mitosis@latest
```

It will prompt you for a project name, and create a new directory with a basic monorepo project structure that includes:

- npm workspaces
- multiple generated outputs, along with build steps for each
- multiple test servers that import the outputs for convenient debugging/testing

Once completed, make sure to read the `README.md` generated in your new project. It will explain the structure of your project, and provide a walkthrough on how to build/test your components.
