# Syncing design systems from Figma

You can leverage Mitosis in conjunction with [Fusion](https://www.builder.io/m/design-to-code) to efficiently translate Figma designs into code.

Fusion is an AI-powered Figma to code toolchain that leverages AI to swiftly and accurately convert Figma designs to clean and responsive code.

To use this integration:

1. In Figma, select the layer you wish to convert and use the Fusion plugin.
2. Click the **Generate Code** button to start the conversion.
3. Set Mitosis as the target framework for the generated code.
4. Copy the code and paste it into a file within the `library/src` directory of your Mitosis project. Mitosis will then automatically adapt this code to your selected frameworks, maintaining a consistent design system across multiple platforms.

This method ensures that developers can work within a unified framework while supporting various technology stacks.
