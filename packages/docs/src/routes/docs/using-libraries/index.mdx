title: Using Libraries - Mitosis

# Using Libraries

## JavaScript libraries

You can use any JavaScript library in your Mitosis components just like you would in any
other framework. Here's an example of using `lodash` in a Mitosis component:

```tsx
import { kebabCase } from 'lodash';

export default function MyComponent(props: { name: string }) {
  return <div>{kebabCase(props.name)}</div>;
}
```

## Framework-specific libraries

Because of the cross-framework nature of Mitosis, you cannot use framework-specific libraries
directly in Mitosis code.

For instance a React form library wouldn't make sense in the context of Mitosis, because
Mitosis components are framework-agnostic, so how would it work with Vue or Svelte?

### Focus on web fundamentals

The web platform has come a long way, and you may not need as many libraries as you think.

For example, for form handling, instead of using a library you can use the native `form` element
and its built-in validation:

```tsx
export default function MyComponent() {
  function handleSubmit(event: SubmitEvent) {
    event.preventDefault();

    const form = event.target as HTMLFormElement;
    if (!form.checkValidity()) {
      alert('Form is invalid');
      return;
    }
    const data = new FormData(form);
    const email = data.get('email');
    console.log(email);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={(event) => handleSubmit(event)}>
      <input type="email" name="email" required />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Use overrides (sparringly)

If you really need to use a framework-specific library, you can use overrides to
provide different implementations for different frameworks.

In the `overrides/` directory of a [Mitosis project](/docs/project-structure/), you can create a file for each
you want to override.

For example, if you have a file in `src/components/foo.lite.tsx` and you need a specific
implemtnation for Angular, for instance to use a specific library or unique feature, you can
create a file `overrides/angular/src/components.foo.ts` and provide the Angular-specific implementation.

See examples in the [overrides directory](https://github.com/BuilderIO/builder/tree/main/packages/sdks/overrides)
of the builder.io SDK.
