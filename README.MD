## Getting Started

The best way to learn Mitosis is to clone our [example project](./examples/basic/) and start tinkering. Otherwise, here are some helpful external resources on trying out Mitosis:

- https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-reusable-components-mitosis-builder-io/

## Docs

Curious about how Mitosis code works under the hood, and how to use it? Learn more [in the overview](docs/overview.md).

## Why use Mitosis?

### Component libraries

Providing a UI component library across multiple frameworks is a _pain_, especially when webcomponents are not an option (e.g. for server side rendering, best performance, etc). With Mitosis, you can write once and run everywhere while maintaining full compatibilty with the target framework.

### Modern workflows for all platforms

Mitosis allows you to incrementally adopt modern and familiar workflows for many different platforms. For instance, when working with Shopify, you can server side render to liquid and hydrate with React.

### JS framework fatigue

If you have ever had to migrate a huge codebase from one framework to another, it's an absolute nightmare. Writing components at a higher level of abstraction allows you to move from one to another with ease.

### Design to code

With Mitosis, you can convert designs from [Figma](https://github.com/BuilderIO/html-to-figma) or Sketch and convert them to clean code for the framework of your choice. You can even use [Builder.io](https://github.com/builderio/builder) to visually drag/drop to build UIs and edit the code _side by side_.
