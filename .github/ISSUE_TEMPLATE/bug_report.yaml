        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report! We are always on the lookout for folks interested in becoming active contributors to Mitosis. Given its large surface area, there is a ton of room for any engineer to make a large and sustained impact on the project. 
      
        We invest a ton of time in helping newcomers get onboarded, and teach them how to make changes to the codebase (see the following examples: [#847](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/issues/847#issuecomment-1307439504), [#372](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/issues/372#issuecomment-1133471614), [#734](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/issues/734#issuecomment-1255453702)).
