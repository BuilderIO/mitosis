        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report. Please bear in mind that we are a _very_ small and lean team, and the surface area of Mitosis is fairly large due to the nature of the project. 
        As the tool is in beta and under active development, we ask for your patience and help in contributing to this amazing project. 
        We always do our best to empower folks to contribute substantially to the project and quickly have an impact.
